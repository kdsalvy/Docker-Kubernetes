# Introduction to containerization using along with Kubernetes 

### Spring Boot Application
A Simple Spring Boot application with only one API /rest/controller.

### Docker
* The objective here is to containerize the application that can be executed anywhere. I have used docker as my container solution. The image used is Ubuntu to run the application.

* Filename dockerfile in root folder is docker YAML file

### Kubernetes
* The orchestration tool being used here is Kubernetes which can be used to bring up the complete application stack.
* k8.yml is being used as the Kubernetes YAML file
